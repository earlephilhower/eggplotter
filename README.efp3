Modified to work better with my own hardware:

* Adjusted shoulder/arm widths to work with M4x20 screws
* Added lifting bump to lower arm because my servo horn too short
* Moved servo contact point closer to middle of lower arm
* Marlin commit e99ddb2fc430a3e0b19851f11fde9d3400b14b42 based-config
* New egg.svg for plotting in Inkscake (200x100)
